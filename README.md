# Patrik's configurations

This repository contains my personal configurations for
things like Windows, Linux, my terminals etc. I will 
therefore not accept any pull requests or changes to this repo.

Feel free to fork this repository or use it as an
inspiration for your own configurations.

## Disclaimer

Running the scripts here without knowing what they do
will most likely make you sad and/or change your
computer settings to something that you don't want.
